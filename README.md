# Movie Clean Architecture

## ‚ú® About
Movie Clean Architecture is a project whose goal was to implement a screen with movie informations using Clean Architecture. To do this, I used The Movie DB API and based the design on the TodoMovies App. I had to make a few modifications to the layout because I couldn't find icons that match the ones in the inspiration app.

## Similar App
I developed the MovieFlix app, which also uses The Movie DB API, and some time ago, I decided to refactor the project taking into account topics that I learned in the last few months. The project doesn't use Clean Architecture, but I developed a robust app that features a home screen, detail tiles, and a search feature that uses debounce.
